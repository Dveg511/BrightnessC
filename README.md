# BrightnessC
earlier I did Brightness changer on python , now I remake it with less function but on C++ 

Realesed function right now :
1. brightness change

function in the future : 
1. Timer
2. gui
3. temperature changer
4. rework from highlevelmonitorconfigurationapi to lowlevelmonitorconfigurationapi

From microsoft wiki :   
 **The physical monitor configuration functions operate using the VESA Control Command Set (MCCS) standard over the I2C interface. 
Many monitors do not fully implement this standard; therefore, using these commands may result in undefined monitor behavior.
We do not recommend using these functions on arbitrary monitors without physically verifying that they work as expected.**
